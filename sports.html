		<h3>Tennis</h3>
		<img src="images.jpg">
		<p>One of my most favorite sports I've played my whole life and plan to make it as a career. I get lessons and practice everyday.</p>
		<p>What I like about this sport is that its just yourself and your not on a team(unless your playing doubles) you have one side of the court all to yourself and can move around freely.
		</p><p>All you need is a racquet a ball and a sparring partner.</p>
		<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<img src="video-game-consoles.jpg">
